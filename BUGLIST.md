1. Ghoul claw ability isn't supposed to be usable if energy is below sixty.

2. Cannot taunt players pets.

 -- CRITICAL --
Use blood strike two times with Reaping talent from unholy talent tree,
Both runes became death runes. Now use blood tap while they are still on cooldown.
It should remove the cooldown of a one death rune. Currently is does not.

4. Using Rune Tap with the glyph whilst Dancing Rune Weapon is up, it 
   should heal the party of the death knight.
