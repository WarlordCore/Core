1. Channeled spells haste issues.

2. Cannot taunt players pets (Water Elemental, Mirror Image, etc (not ghouls, hunter pets, etc)).

 -- CRITICAL --
Use blood strike two times with Reaping talent from unholy talent tree,
Both runes became death runes. Now use blood tap while they are still on cooldown.
It should remove the cooldown of a one death rune. Currently is does not.

4. Using Rune Tap with the glyph whilst Dancing Rune Weapon is up, it 
   should heal the party of the death knight.
   Rune Tap shouldn't damage the enemy either.
5. Mind Amplification Dish (engineering), doesn't work at all.
6. Explosion of Living Bomb shoudn't break Dragon's Breath.
7. Shadowstep and Blink remove combat.
   (Related to sanctuary zone(s)).
8. Rogue: When you cast Cheapshot, Garrote, Rupture, Expose Armor, Kidneyshot the poison from Main Hand should be applied.
9. Cobalt frag bomb (belt also), removes a charge of the effects due to the damage which is incorrect.
10. Intervene aura range is not 10yds. See commits possible fix. (Might be fixed.)
11. Texture issues with fear (and charge/intercept?), causing the caster to fall underground.
12. Rupture damage a little high/bugged? Need more research.
13. Mutilate damage way too low.
