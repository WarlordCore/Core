BUGLISTGhoul claw ability isn't supposed to be usable if energy is below sixty.

Water Elemental Taunting (dk taunt atleast, w/b others ..?)

 -- CRITICAL --
Use blood strike two times with Reaping talent from unholy talent tree,
Both runes became death runes. Now use blood tap while they are still on cooldown.
It should remove the cooldown of a one death rune. Currently is does not.

See green comment below there.
 -- CRITICAL --

Using Rune Tap with the glyph whilst Dancing Rune Weapon is up, it 
should heal the party of the death knight.
